Below is an overview of these components. 

_Security management screens_ – screens available to system administrator for configuring <<users,user>> access rights.

_Login screen_ − system <<login_screen,login>> window. This window provides user authentication by username and password. The database stores password hashes for security.

The <<userSession,UserSession>> object is created upon login. This is the central security element associated with the currently authenticated user and containing information on data access rights.

The user login process is described in <<login,>>.

_Roles_ − user roles. A <<roles,role>> is a system object, which, on the one hand, matches the <<permissions,permission>> set required to perform specific functions, and on the other hand, the subset of users who must have these permissions.

The permissions can have the following types:

* _Screen Permissions_ − an ability to open a screen.

* _Entity Operation Permissions_ − an ability to perform operations with an entity: read, create, update, delete.

* _Entity Attribute Permissions_ − access to an arbitrary entity attribute: modify, read only, access denied. See also <<entity_attribute_access,>>.

* _Specific Permissions_ − permissions for some named functionality.

* _UI Permissions_ − control access to screen elements. 

_Access Groups_ − user access groups. The <<groups,groups>> have a hierarchical structure, with each element defining a set of <<constraints,constraints>>, allowing controlling access to individual entity instances (at table row level). For example, users can view the documents that have been created in their department only.
