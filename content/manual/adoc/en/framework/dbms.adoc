=== Database Components
This section provides information on how to configure the application for working with particular DBMS. It also describes a script-based mechanism, which enables creating a new database and keeping it up-to-date throughout the entire cycle of the development and operation of the application.

Database components belong to the Middleware <<app_tiers,block>>; other blocks of the application do not have direct access to the database. 

Some additional information on working with the database is provided in the <<databases>> section.
