==== Main Window Layout

The mechanism described below allows you to design the application main window layout with CUBA Generic UI technology by creating an XML-descriptor and Java controller, and using <<gui_vcl,UI components>> and <<datasources,data sources>>. 

The main window is defined by a specific screen with `mainWindow` identifier. Its controller should be derived from the `AbstractMainWindow` class. 

The following special components may be used in the main window in addition to the standard UI components:

* `AppMenu` – main application menu.

* `FoldersPane` – application and search <<folders_pane,folders panel>>.

*  `AppWorkArea` – work area, the required component for opening screens in the `THIS_TAB`, `NEW_TAB` and `NEW_WINDOW` modes.

* `UserIndicator` – the field which displays the name of the current user, as well as enables selecting substituted users, if any.

The `setUserNameFormatter()` method allows you to represent the user's name in a format different from the `User` instance name:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/main_window.java[]

* `NewWindowButton` – the button which opens a new main window in a separate browser tab.

* `LogoutButton` – the application logout button.

* `TimeZoneIndicator` – the label displaying the current user's <<timeZone,time zone>>.

* `FtsField` – the full text search field.

In order to define the special components, add the `xmlns:main` namespace to the screen: 

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/main_window_1.xml[]
----

The `AppWorkArea` component is designed to show application screens. If the <<cuba.web.appWindowMode,cuba.web.appWindowMode>> application property is `TABBED` (default), the work area shows a TabSheet with open screens. Otherwise a single open screen is shown. The <<cuba.web.mainTabSheetMode,cuba.web.mainTabSheetMode>> and <<cuba.web.managedMainTabSheetMode,cuba.web.managedMainTabSheetMode>> application properties define how the tabs content is handled when the tabs are switched. When no screens are opened, the work area shows components defined in the `initialLayout` internal element:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/main_window_2.xml[]
---- 

The initial screen layout (`initialLayout`) is removed from `AppWorkArea` when the first application screen is opened, and added back when all screens are closed. You can add `AppWorkArea.StateChangeListener` to handle changing the work area between the initial layout and application screens. Such listener can, for example, refresh the initial layout data. 

The platform provides 2 standard main window implementations. XML descriptor of the default main window with horizontal menu on top is available in `/com/haulmont/cuba/web/app/mainwindow/mainwindow.xml`, its corresponding controller class is `AppMainWindow`. Another available template contains the <<gui_SideMenu, vertical side menu>>.

The standard implementation can be extended in the project, like any other application screen. Example of an extending screen:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/main_window_3.xml[]
----

This screen should be registered in <<screens.xml,web-screens.xml>> file with the `mainWindow` identifier.

The easiest way to extend the main screen is provided by CUBA Studio: select *Generic UI* in the project tree and click *New > Screen* in the context menu. Then select the template for the new main screen on the *Legacy Screen Templates* tab. The new `ext-mainwindow.xml` file will be created in the Web module and automatically registered in `web-screens.xml`.

CUBA Platform provides 2 standard main window layout templates: with horizontal menu and with the <<gui_SideMenu, side menu>>. The standard main window implementation may be fully replaced with a custom one. For example:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/main_window_4.xml[]
---- 

The resulting main window is shown below: 

image::main_window_1.png[align="center"]

The same main window with an open screen: 

image::main_window_2.png[align="center"]

The <<cuba.web.showBreadCrumbs,cuba.web.showBreadCrumbs>> application property allows you to hide the navigation panel (breadcrumbs) above the opened screen.

The appearance of the `AppWorkArea` can be customized using SCSS variables with `$cuba-maintabsheet-*` prefix. You can change these variables in the visual editor after creating a <<web_theme_extension,theme extension>> or a <<web_theme_creation,custom theme>>.
