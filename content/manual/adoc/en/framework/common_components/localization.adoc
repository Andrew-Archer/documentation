==== Messages Localization

Applications based on CUBA platform support messages localization, which means that all user interface elements can be displayed in the language, selected by user.

[TIP]
====
See https://www.cuba-platform.com/guides/localization-in-cuba-applications[Localization in CUBA applications] guide to learn how localized messages within the CUBA application can be defined and used.
====

Language selection options are determined by the combination of <<cuba.localeSelectVisible,cuba.localeSelectVisible>> and <<cuba.availableLocales,cuba.availableLocales>> application properties.

This section describes the localization mechanism and rules of localized messages creation.
