== Security Subsystem

The CUBA platform uses the following methods to control access rights: 

* The <<roles,role-based>> system for assigning user <<permissions,permissions>>. A set of roles and permissions can be configured by the system administrator during the system deployment or later in production.

* A hierarchical structure of <<groups,access groups>> with <<constraints,constraint>> inheritance.

* Access control at the following levels: 

** Operations on entities (read, create, update, delete): for example, user `*Smith*` can view documents, but cannot create, update or delete them.

** Entity attributes (modify, read, access denied): user `*Smith*` can view all document attributes except for `amount`.

** Access to particular entity instances (access control at the row level): user `*Smith*` can view the documents that have been created in their department only.

* Integration with <<ldap,LDAP>> with an ability to implement SSO (Single Sign-On) for *Windows* users. For more information on SSO see the IDP addon https://github.com/cuba-platform/idp-addon/wiki[documentation].
