==== Setting up a Web Client Cluster

This section describes the following deployment configuration:

image::cluster_webclient.png[align="center"]

Servers `host1` and `host2` host Tomcat instances with the `app` web-app implementing the Web Client block. Users access the load balancer at `++http://host0/app++`, which redirects their requests to the servers. Server `host3` hosts a Tomcat instance with the `app-core` web-app that implements the Middleware block.

[WARNING]
====
The user's <<gui_framework,Generic UI>> state and <<userSession,UserSession>> are located on the single Web Client node which performed the user's login. Therefore the load balancer must maintain *sticky sessions* (AKA session affinity) to ensure that all requests from the user during the session are sent to the same Web Client node.
